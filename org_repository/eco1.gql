#ECO-1	

# The ontology is in ontology.gql. It's summarized here for convenience.
#   organization -> person
#   organization -> platform -> environment -> tool
#
# NOTES
#   I thought it would be
#   organization -> platform -> environment -> tool -> dataset (e.g. specific table, s3 bucket, HDFS file/directory)
#   But I see dataset-environment in the cip example.
#
#   Can we renamed "owned-by" to "ownee" or "asset" or something else?
